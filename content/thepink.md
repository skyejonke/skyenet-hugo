Come join us!

Are you:
- queer
- obsessed with pink
- irrationally hateful towards blue and/or other colors
- open to new ideas
- willing to accept a less corporeal form of existence 

Then you may be interested in joining our ~~cult~~ fun club! We meet every
eleventh of ███ at █████ street in █████, USA. If you wish to be considered to
join, please display your devotion by painting at least 50% of your belongings
pink. After this simply wait for the sign. The sign could be any of many things,
such as:

- Intense desire to speak about Pink at all opportunities 
- Thoughts about the death of capitalism (more than usual), as well as the world
  in general. 
- Ritual burnings of non-pink (especially blue) belongings.
- Going out of your way to be around pink as often as possible (such as
  customizing your computer to be as pink as possible).
- Occasional blood sacrifice to an unknowing but all powerful entitiy, generally
  with either a pink tainted knife or some other pink implement, especially such
  activities where the sacrifice's blood or corpse begins to glow pink.
  
If any of the above happens to you, congratulations! You're part of the ~~cult~~
family! Do NOT attempt to run. We will be arriving to pick you up. Any attempt
to flee from your new destiny will be met with extreme prejudice. "I didn't
expect it to be real" is not a valid excuse. You are part of something bigger
now. You will be part of The Pink, as will we all, when it inevitably comes down
to envelope the Earth.
